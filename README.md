# IP-FinalProject

1) Download Git https://git-scm.com/
    - When installing, select option to use both regular command line and git bash

    - NPM allows us to install the 3rd party dependencies we will need for our Node.js sever
3) Create a new folder to house the project

4) Right click inside of new folder and select open git bash

5) In the git bash console, enter the following commands in the order seen below:
    - git clone https://github.com/spetsing/IP-FinalProject.git
    - cd IP-FinalProject
    - npm install
    - npm install bower -g
    - bower install
    
6) All your dependencies should now be installed. You will need to run our node server.js to test the app

7) Navigate to the folder that holds server.js and type this git bash command to start the server
	-node server.js
	- you should see a message that the server is running on port 8080

8) Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/
